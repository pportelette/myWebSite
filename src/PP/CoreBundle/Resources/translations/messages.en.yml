    title: ABOUT WORK
    body: |
      I have been evolving in photovoltaic industry since 2009 and through my work experiences, I often have been faced to issues such as working at the same time on the same documents, or the difficulty to find and access remotely to information produced in the company.
      
      I quickly became passionate about web technologies which, when combined with databases, are particularly well suited to solve these kind of problems.

      That's why I decided to retrain to web development in order to combine my both interests in web development and information systems.
