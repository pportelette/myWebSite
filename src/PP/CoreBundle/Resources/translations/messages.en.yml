    title: ABOUT WORK
    body: |
      Through my work experiences, I often have been faced to issues such as working at the same time on the same documents, or the difficulty to find and access remotely to information produced in the company.
      
      I quickly turned and passionate about web applications which, when combined with databases, are particulary well suited to solve these kind of problems.

      That's why I decided to retrain to web development in order to combine my both interests in web development and information systems.
